      "CN IV (Trochlear)",
      "Both CN III and CN IV"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Both CN III and CN IV",
    "explanation": "Eye movement is controlled by three cranial nerves: CN III (oculomotor) controls most extraocular muscles, CN IV (trochlear) controls the superior oblique muscle, and CN VI (abducens, not listed) controls the lateral rectus. The optic nerve (CN II) is responsible for vision, not eye movement."

      "Calcitonin",
      "Parathyroid hormone",
      "Aldosterone",
      "Both calcitonin and parathyroid hormone"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Both calcitonin and parathyroid hormone",
    "explanation": "Both calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulate calcium homeostasis in opposing ways. PTH increases serum calcium by enhancing bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and vitamin D activation. Calcitonin decreases serum calcium by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing renal calcium excretion."

      "Bradycardia",
      "Increased appetite"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Bradycardia",
    "explanation": "Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is a characteristic feature of hypothyroidism due to decreased beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity and reduced metabolic demand. Other symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, and hair loss."

      "Increased FEV1 and reduced FVC"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Reduced FEV1 with normal FVC leading to reduced FEV1/FVC ratio",
    "explanation": "Obstructive lung diseases (like COPD and asthma) are characterized by airflow limitation during expiration, resulting in reduced FEV1 with normal or near-normal FVC, leading to a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio (<0.7). This contrasts with restrictive patterns where both FEV1 and FVC are reduced proportionally."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Pulmonary embolism",
    "explanation": "Type 1 respiratory failure is characterized by hypoxemia (low PaO2) with normal or low PaCO2. Pulmonary embolism causes V/Q mismatch leading to hypoxemia without CO2 retention. COPD exacerbation and obesity hypoventilation typically cause type 2 failure (hypoxemia with hypercapnia)."

    "correctAnswer": "Triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin)",
    "explanation": "Triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics (usually amoxicillin and clarithromycin) for 7-14 days is the standard first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication. This approach has eradication rates of 70-90% and significantly reduces ulcer recurrence."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Nonmaleficence",
    "explanation": "The principle of nonmaleficence, 'first, do no harm,' is violated when a physician's negligence directly leads to harm. While beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest) is also relevant, the direct causation of harm through negligence primarily breaches nonmaleficence."
